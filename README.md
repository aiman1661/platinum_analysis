The main script for data analysis is in .py file.
This outputs .xlsx files and a pandas DataFrame.

The .xlsx files in the repo contains final calculations for possible allowed 
body-centered-cubic (BCC) and face-centered-cubic (FCC) Miller indices (hkl)
and errors.

The .pdf file contains a comprehensive overview of the problem and solutions
based on the data analysis done, where we ultimately guess the elemental metal
based on initial diffraction intensity data.
